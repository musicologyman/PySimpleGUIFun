# PySimpleGuiFun

This represents yet another attempt to get PySimpleGUI to run properly
on my Mac (Monterey). *Before installing,* I ran `brew install python-tk@3.10`
in hopes of ensuring that the python bindings for tkinter would be on my
machine.

Also, I think this may be the first time I've run PySimpleGUI using ver. 3.10.,
so I'm obviously not sure if some of my older PySimpleGUI code will still run
without modifications in their virtual environments or without a fresh
installation (or re-installation) of the Homebrew `python-tk` package.
